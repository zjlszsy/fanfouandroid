# Fanfou Android Client 别吃了
This is yet another Android Client for Chinese social network Fanfou.com. This English app strips off all the noisy functionality and leaves only the core view and post functions, and thus giving users a more simplistic experience. (NO this is definitely NOT because I am too lasy to write more functions.)

## Login to your account

Users are required to have a pre-registered Fanfou account. You can register here at: [Fanfou](http://fanfou.com/register)

This app (别吃了）does NOT collet your data, whatever that maybe.
